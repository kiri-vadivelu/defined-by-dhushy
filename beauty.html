                <h1>Authentic Photoshoot Makeup </h1>
                <p>Your professional photographer should be well versed in all aspects of the photoshoot, including how your clothing and makeup choices would impact the quality of pictures. However, although they may know a few things about makeup, but likely not one of their primary areas of expertise. An analogy is that your photographer is similar to your general physician. Your general physician may know a lot about medicine, but is not a specialist in any one area.</p>
                <p>How makeup shows up in photographs is much different and more pronounced than how it appears when you wear it normally. It takes an artful and experienced eye to see the structure in each face, and then use professional techniques to ensure that beauty comes out in your photographs. A professional photoshoot makeup artist knows exactly what products to use and where to apply them. Makeup artists also know exactly how certain types of makeup will affect how the photographs turn out, as well as how light will affect the makeup shades and they work with your face. </p>
                <p>Especially with so many different factors that go into the photoshoot, you do not want makeup to get in the way or be an area of concern. Make sure you have a professional photoshoot makeup artist that can provide their opinion as to the best way to coordinate your makeup selection. A photoshoot makeup is a small investment that worth every penny. </p>
