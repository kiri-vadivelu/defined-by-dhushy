                <h1>Frequestly Asked Questions</h1>     
            <h3>How do I prepare for the makeup?</h3>
            <p>Make sure to get a good night of sleep, drink plenty of water and wash in cool water with mild soap or cleanser. Do not apply any makeup products. Clean up your brow shape by either tweezing, waxing or threading.</p>
            <h3>What is your makeup application process?</h3>
            <p>The skin will be prepped for makeup by removing any excess makeup or dirt on the skin. Moisturizer and primer are applied according to your skin type. Eye makeup will be done prior to the foundation to avoid eye shadow "fallout". Brows are filled in followed by contour, bronzer, blush and highlighter. Lashes are then applied following a lip color. The look is completed with setting powder and finishing spray.</p>
            <h3>What makeup brands do you use?</h3>
            <p>I use high-end, professional grade products to ensure the best quality and natural looking skin texture. Preferred brands include NARS, M.A.C, MAKEUP FOREVER, TARTE, SMASHBOX, LAURAMERCIER, ANASTASIA BEVERLY HILLS, BECCA, URBANDECAY AND BOBBI BROWN. </p>
            <h3>What is your style of makeup?</h3>
            <p>I always strive for modern, natural and realistic skin appearance that is pleasing to eyes as well as camera sensors. Personally, I distance from makeup that alter skin colours or textures.

            <section class="questions">
                <h3>How long will my makeup application take?</h3>
                <p>Usually 30 to 45 minutes per person depending on the occasions. </p>
    
                <h3>What should I bring for my makeup?</h3>
                <p>If you require false eyelashes, please bring your own. </p>
    
                <h3>How do you process payments?</h3>
                <p>Preferred methods are cash and or e-transfer.</p>
    
                <h3>How do I reserve you for the day?</h3>
                <p>All reservations can be done online, email or direct message. A non-refundable fee of $50.00 confirms your reservation. </p>
                <h3>Do you travel around the city?</h3>
                <p>Yes, within Toronto and surrounding area about 25km radius. Any excess mileage may be extra.  </p>
                <h3>When should I hire second MUA?</h3>
                <p>When five or more people require makeup, second person is recommended. Makeup service rates are calculated per person within the booked time frame.</p>
                <h3>What is the cancellation policy?</h3>
                <p>Generally, all reservation deposits are non-refundable. However, the funds can be used to reserve another day depending on the circumstances. </p>
